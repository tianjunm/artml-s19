### Project 1

With a strong desire to further explore the Paradox panel topics, we want to know how the computer algorithm sees pictures differently and whether it has a similar bias as we humans do. We would also like to apply style transfer to our generated differences for an artistic rendering of the differences, and an out-of-box solution is used to upscale the transformed image.
This project is inspired by the adversarial attacks in machine learning. An adversarial attack consists of subtly modifying an original image in such a way that the changes are almost undetectable to the human eye. It is what caused the biased output in machine learning.
